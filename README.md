# PlayABQ

PlayABQ is an Android application built as a submission to the [2015-16 UNM/CNM App Contest][App Contest].

The app provides a filtering interface for finding parks and community centers around the City of Albuquerque.

PlayABQ uses data provided by the City of Albuquerque's [open data sources][CABQ opendata] as well as hand-collected data from the city's website.

The most recent build of the app will always be named `app-release.apk` in kept in the root directory of this repository.  It is not currently available via the Google Play store, so downloading and installing this file is the best way to try the app out.
